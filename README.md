# Music Store Data Analysis Project

This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis workflow, from problem formulation to providing data-driven business recommendations. Using a relational database of a music store, I used SQL to explore sales, customer, and operational data.

### **Project Goals**

* **Identify Revenue Drivers:** Pinpoint which countries, cities, and content are generating the most revenue.
* **Analyze Customer Behavior:** Understand customer loyalty and segment buyers to create targeted marketing strategies.
* **Improve Operational Efficiency:** Evaluate the sales performance of employees to inform management decisions.

### **Key Insights**

* **Market Dominance:** The analysis revealed that the **United States** is the top revenue-generating country, and **Rock** is the most profitable genre.
* **Customer Loyalty:** A small group of repeat customers generates the majority of the store's revenue, highlighting the importance of customer retention.
* **Employee Effectiveness:** The top-performing sales agent was identified by the total revenue they generated, a key metric for performance evaluation.
